## Electric bicycles are cool, this is fact!

Not sure how I landed on "[DIY 55$ 24AH Lithium-Ion 18650 E-Bike battery 100+ Mile Range: complete build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjr2LKmhdVw)", but this created chain reaction, here I am looking at:

- [electric bike review](http://electricbikereview.com)
- [Sondors Electric Bike](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sondors-electric-bike)
- [Is the $500 Storm Electric Bike on Indiegogo a Good Deal?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZXdjm4DW50)
- [WORLD'S FASTEST ELECTRIC BIKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFGfECSwgjg)
- and lots more..... as well as a reminiscence of past search that landed me on [underground bike park](http://www.louisvillemegacavern.com/attractions/6/underground-bike-park).

Being hit by shit storm of information, I decided to stop. That said, I have been hit by inspiration to rebuild fleet of two wheeled monsters.

## Some history in order cause I do love bikes, even if I forgot about them for a while.

I have not been actively involved with this hobby of mine for a while now, family and work, who know how long, at list five years or so. That will change for sure.

I was brought up with BMX, Motocross and MTB. Since four years of age on a bicycle, since ten years of age till twenty three I was dedicated BMX rider. Thats how I defined my self. Now after some brake time at the age of 30 I think I am ready to engage the gear again. 

I had shitty bmx bikes for as long as I remember, I slaved days and hours, repairing them, building them from shit parts (cause in love but no money), fixing damn bent forks, bent cranksets and inner tubes from all the jumps and tricks that did not go as planned. That changed when my family moved to US where after slaving for some time in retail industry I finally got top of the crop Trek Vert 2, no hating please, it was 2003. I still have that bike, in my parent's basement, it has cracks and bends by intersection of down tube and headset joint. Frame is truly the only part that is left from original, I have poured in tons of money into parts. Oh yeah, it is also the heaviest BMX bike every one told me they ever rode, don't know if I should be proud of it.

## All this said leaves me with following hope and goal.

I think my long term goal for this endeavor will be to get my self:

- BMX: [Verde Radia Bike](http://www.danscomp.com/products-BIKES/102464/2015_Verde_Radia_Bike.html)
- TRIALS: [Inspired Fourplay Pro](http://www.inspiredbicycles.com/inspired_fourplay_pro_bike_p67.php)
- MTB, not sure what I want.
- Electric commuter / cruiser. Possibly build one from scratch or buy something I like. Will see. I do like electricity : )
