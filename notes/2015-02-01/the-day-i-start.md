# The Day I Start

## Today is the day,

the day I will start to take notes to reflect on matters. This is an exercise of some sort, I think. I need to improve few items in question and I think this is the way to accomplish this. Let's revisit this in a year or two, would be fun to look back. 

## Of all the things, 

it would be great for this little exercise to un-challenge myself in general areas of writing such as grammar, punctuation and sentence structure. Challenge is: I have never really liked writing. The only thing I ever liked in world of written word was to consume literature and even that came in a long adventure of self discipline to be able to do so. So let this be an exercise in discipline of written word; practice, practice, practice.

I have grown up, partially. I am ready for this. Personal resolution and guidelines to this endeavor would be:

- KEEP IT FUCKING SHORT, these are NOTES not diary entries.
- Never publish right away. Iterate, mix, change, proofread.
- I am writing when my instinct tells me that what I want to write about is interesting, valuable and worth of keeping. World does not need another endless pipeline of info.
- Keep it emotional (true to my soul and mind), technical (no bull), objectively subjective to my core reasons of doing this in a first place (like this makes any sense).
- Notes are applicable to everything I do or want to do.
- I am not going to bitch, but if need to: let it be constructive criticism.
- It has to be partially naive and always transparent.
- No self censoring, but respect is the key.

## Footnotes

This is about 10th iteration, and I am proving to my self that my grammar sucks as I have misspelled word "grammar" three times while writing this footnote. This whole thing is fun and is growing on me. Not my first note, must admit. Right after I realized that I need some sort of guidelines to adhere to I jumped on this one.
