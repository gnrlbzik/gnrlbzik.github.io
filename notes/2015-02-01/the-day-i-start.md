# The Day I Start

## Today is the day,

the day I will start to take notes to reflect on matters. This is an exercise of some sort, I think. I want to improve few items in question and I think this is the way to accomplish this. Let's revisit this in a year or two, would be fun. 

Of all the things, it would be great for this little exercise to help me tackle my challenges in grammar, punctuation and sentence structure. One other challenge that comes to mind is how long it takes me to write and express my ideas. On grander scheme: I want to project my thoughts so that I can retain them better emotionally, technically, subjectively but w/ objectivity in mind.

## Lets do this 

and outline this personal resolution or so called guidelines about how and what I will write about:

- What ever I find interesting, valuable and worth of keeping.
- Emotional (true to my soul and mind), technical (no bull), objectively subjective (like this makes sense)
- Applicable to everything I do or want to do
- No bitching but if need to: let it be constructive criticism
- Partially naive and always transparent
- No self censoring but always with respect
- Let it be with touch of "humorous" please
