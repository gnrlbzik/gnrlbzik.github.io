# Tasty JavaScript Closures

### Probably useless intro, but hey.

I ocasionally try to revisit my pocket list, where I deposit hell lot of links on daily basis to revisit. Today is one of the lucky days when I decided to do so and voila, stumbled on javascript closures in pile of thousands of links.

### Let's recap the encounters.

At some point in past, may be 4-6 years ago, when I would go through interviews, it happened to be time when I was asked about them quite often. I had a good grasp I thought, but it was always hard to clearly summarize them, probably due to my "grasp" on them just being an illusion of having one. It always boiled down to how I saw them and how I used them, and that would be to persist the state of what ever, it is a neat little pattern that you get accustomed rather quickly and don't pay whole lot of detail to. But as saying goes, devil is in details, so I cold heartedly advise to read following article.

So the article in question is [Understanding JavaScript Closures](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/understanding-javascript-closures/) by Angus Croll, I quickly pocketed it away back in time, article it self dates to 2010. Future read it was, or may be I even spent some time on it, who knows, don't quite remember that. The fact is, I wasn't wrong about quality of the article and hence why I have pocketed it away.

### So my take on this matter,

as I stand on this topic today, for better or worse, here are things I would of liked my self to communicate to others at the time of discussions.

So why are these closures so tasty, a.k.a. talking points:

- If you are in to baking, you proabably producing closures as one would produce muffins, and me like some muffins :). Every function definition is esentially a closure. It just happened that yummier part of this interaction lays as useage of pattern that creates persistance state.
