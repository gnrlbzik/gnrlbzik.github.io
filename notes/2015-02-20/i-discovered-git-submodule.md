# I discovered GIT-submodule

## Few weeks back,

I discovered [git submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule), it sparked my interest for reasons of future work I need to do on few projects. This was not so urgent at the time so I quickly pocketed it away.

Today as usual I was reading hacker news and spotted post about git submodule:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9079447, it talks about [Mastering Git submodules](https://medium.com/@porteneuve/mastering-git-submodules-34c65e940407) article on Medium. Another good article surfaced in comments [Git Submodules basic explanation](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255) to digest as part this read effort.

## Possible alternatives

that came up while reading up on hacker news post were:

- https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo
- https://github.com/buildinspace/peru

will check them out at some point.
