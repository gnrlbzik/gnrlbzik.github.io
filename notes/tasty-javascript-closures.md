# Tasty JavaScript Closures

### Probably useless intro, but hey.

I ocasionally try to revisit my pocket list, where I deposit hell lot of links on daily basis to revisit them later. Today is the day I stumbled on link to javascript closures. Let's recap the encounters.

At some point in past, may be 4-5 years ago, when I would go through interviews, I was asked about them quite often. I had a good grasp I thought, but it was always hard to clearly summarize them, probably due to my "grasp" on them just being an illusion of having one.

So the article in question is [Understanding JavaScript Closures](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/understanding-javascript-closures/) by Angus Croll, I quickly pocked it away back in a day for future read or even may be spent some time on it, who knows, don't quite remember that.

### So my take on this matter,

as I stand on this topic today. So why are these closures so tasty:

- if you are in to baking, you proabably producing them as one would produce muffins, and me like some muffins :)
